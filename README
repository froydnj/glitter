This is the README for glitter, a library to access git repositories.

glitter does not do very much yet; as you can see from looking at the
source, it doesn't even have a proper DEFPACKAGE or ASDF system
definition.  It's not been tested much.  It's mostly being made
available so that I can hack on it from multiple computers.  If you
happen to find it useful or improve on it by hacking it yourself, that's
just a bonus.
